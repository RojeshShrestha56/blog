          "Coding interviews require a different set of skillset compared to practical software engineering. Interviews mainly test on algorithms and data structures, which most software developers do not come across in their day-day work. I’ve always wanted to work on my interviewing skillsets so that when the opportunity to interview arises, I’ll be ready for the interview. My efforts to incorporate Leetcode as a daily route was sporadic over the last few years. There will be times when I get really motivated and managed to leetcode almost daily but eventually when life comes knocking back, the routine started to wane off.",

          "Or every software engineer in the world, problem solving sounds like a monster that will haunt you for the rest of your career, and that’s kind of true to be honest, how can it not be while til this day, it is still one of the biggest standards (if not the biggest) used to evaluate candidates at almost 90% of tech companies, even at FAANG. if you happen to be the smartest engineer among your peers, you’d still have to excel your DSA (Data structures and algorithms) interview.",

Whether you need to learn: Node, Express, SQL, NoSQL, REST, JSON, APIs, or the latest fancy technologies, you can do it for free, leveraging the power of the internet. I’ve personally gathered, watched, tested, and reviewed thousands of resources, to come up with the only: JavaScript-based backend roadmap you’ll ever need in 2022.",

      desc:
          "One of the most common things I’ve found is that people who graduate in computer science or another IT-related field where design patterns were taught — but never sufficiently trained to use them either — forget about them or find them of no use in their software development career. They are, nonetheless, core abilities that all developers should have, mainly because as your software development career progresses, you will be expected to recognize patterns and utilize them to construct microservices/ systems/solutions. There Are Several Reasons Why Design Pattern Will Be Beneficial To You. Simply put, design patterns are used to make the task easier.— For instance, when writing a program, the primary rule of an object is that all attributes must be private and cannot be accessed by other classes. So, how can we make our code more readable and adaptable? You can utilize the Creational Design Pattern to clean up your code.",

          "There’s a point in our lives when we stop learning, a certain age when we slow down in our careers and then focus more on personal goals rather than career goals. As for me, that was my early 30s, when I became a mother, when it’s impossible to get enough sleep, let alone do anything extra. Mid last year, after surpassing the newborn stage of my kids, I decided to get up again and jump start new things in my career (I’ll be sharing more of this in future posts). Happy to say that even though it’s been only 6 months, I feel like a new journey is just about to begin. In this whole upskilling journey thus far, I learned 2 things : We should never stop learning, and anyone can learn anything anytime. If you find yourself in that similar stalled situation, I’m not blaming you. This is totally normal. But remember that it’s not the end of your growth either. When you are ready (or once you can), start doing these things to get back on the habit of learning continuously:",

          "You’ve probably heard the word 'coding' one too many times by now (if you sleep on the internet like I do). It’s also no news that industries have become largely digital with the advancement in technology and the need to be computer savvy is almost non-negotiable in the work space today. This is where coding comes in! But what IS coding? Why the rave about it? Let's find out. Coding is simply the computer language used to develop apps, websites and software. As the computer doesn't understand words, Codes help to tell the computer what to do. Cool right? See Also: Coding is fun. So why coding? Why do you need to bother with it? Let me let you in on 10 reasons no one else will tell you;",
